# Components and style props

- Components example: Heading, Text, Container
- Style props are CSS properties that can be applied to components.
- `<Component as="h1">`: "as" is a prop that allows you to specify the element that the component should be rendered as.
- `<Box sx={boxStyles}>`: "sx" is a prop that allows you to pass in styles to the component, in this case it is a CSS object.
